# VECC_CBM-Root_Histograms
This repository will serve as the directory containing all the code that I have executed to plot histograms and learn basic Data Analysis using mini-CBM data with the CBM Root software via the Grid computing facility at VECC Kolkata. The language used is standard C++, the primary language for ROOT Programming. CBM Root has two other ROOT dependencies namely- FAIRSOFT and FAIRROOT. CBM is a Heavy ion particle accelarator with gold atom collisions which is one of the experiments at the FAIR (Facility for Antiproton Ion Research) at Darmstadt, Germany. My job primarily deals with CBM MuCH (Compressed Baryonic Matter- Muon Chambers) .
